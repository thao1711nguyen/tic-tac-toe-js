This is a very simple tic tac toe game that can be played on the browser.
The project is part of the course "Javascript" by The Odin Project. 
Check it out at the link: "https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-tic-tac-toe"

In this project, I use plain javascript only and use factory function to create object instead of class.
