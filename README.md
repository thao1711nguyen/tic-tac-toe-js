This is a very simple tic tac toe game that can be played on the browser.
The project is part of the course "Javascript" by The Odin Project. 
Check it out at the link: "https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-tic-tac-toe"

User can choose to play with another user or play with the computer.

- In this project, I learn 2 things: 
    + Implement minimax algorithm 
    + The use of "this" keyword
